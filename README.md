# GAFerm
This GitHub page contains the code to the GAFerm app. This app allow you to use six different growth kinetic models to simulate fermentation processes in different operation conditions. Also you can use Genetic Algorithms to carry out parametric optimization and to find the optimal inflow rate to a feed batch bioreactor.
